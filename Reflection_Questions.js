// What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
// I could have created a more detailed project timeline and broken down tasks more clearly, prioritizing the key features first.

// Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
// Authentication and JWT implementation were tricky, but using more tutorials and examples would help me understand better for future projects.

// What would you add to or change about your application if given more time?
// I would add features like user profile management, post categories, and a better comment moderation system.

// Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
// Plan features and user flow carefully before starting. Focus on clean and organized code. Testing should be done frequently to catch issues early.
